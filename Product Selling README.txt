A terminal game assigned to my Python class where the goal is to maximize profits within 10 game days. Initial money
and resources was given to the player, and they made choices to sell or buy product depending on whether the randomized
buy/sell value was desirable. At the end of the 10 day loop, the player information was displayed.
